# Event Storming (Currently Studying)

* To clarify the Domain of the Application.
* How to model the Application
* We are talking about big applications
* One person to conduct the workshop
* Explore to consolidate everything
* Dynamic and califying to everyone
* People usually use "PostIt".
  
- Goal: Understand and Map what happens in the System, through the events (Domain Event: AN Event that is processed by the system and makes sense to be exposed) generated by the system. So, you have to list it. (Suggestion: An Orange PostIt)
