# Event Storming (Currently Studying)

* To clarify the Domain of the Application.
* How to model the Application
* We are talking about big applications
* One person to conduct the workshop
* Explore to consolidate everything
* Dynamic and clarifying to everyone
* Resolve complexity business
* People usually use "PostIt".
* Goal: Understand and Map what happens in the System, through the events
* With it, the understanding of the project gets much more clear (to developers, to the Domain Experts, etc). With it, everyone can communicate with the ubiquitous language (universal language)

## Cards

- First, List the Actors (Domain Experts). Then, list the Events and then list all the Commands. Then, put the PostIts in this order:
  * Actor -> Command -> Event (Exemple: Video Administrator (Yellow) -> do Video Upload (Blue) -> Upload Done (Orange)

## Main Cards

- Event: Domain Event: An Event (everything that happened in the past) (a result of an action) that is processed by the system and makes sense to be exposed in Event Storming) generated by the system. So, you have to list it. (Suggestion: An Orange PostIt.
- Command: Someone (Domain Expert: Yellow "PostIt") "does the command" (Blue "PostIt") (Can be a user, an administrator, buyer, etc.). Every event is generated by a command. Ex: Finish a Purchase (Command) -> Purchase Done (Event). With commands, you can understand the operations that your system does.

## Other Cards

- Decision made: A Green PostIt that can be putted to make a decision
- Policy: A Purple PostIt. Something that happens through a trigger (Ex: When I create a video, send an email, so, it can be automatically or by a final user). "When I do something, does anything happen?" Use policy in this case.

## Chronological
- The events need to be put in order (Can be parallel and can be through business areas)

## Event Origin
- Can be:
  * An Action based in the Client (A command executed by the client)
  * An External System
  * A Scheduler (time)
  * A Policy (a consequence of another event)

## Aggregator
- It is a set of entities and valued objects that have business rules and validation to guarantee consistency in the business. 
- Between a Command and an Domain Event you will always have an Aggregator
- In the Aggregator, we have the business rules.
- Every command talks with an Agregator, and this aggregator is responsible for generating the event.

## Delimited Contexts
